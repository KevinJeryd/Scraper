# Scraper

A program to scrape items from amazon and email you when they have gone down in price. Currently a bunch of bugs and stuff both in the gui and the model. 
It seems threading messes a bit with the program and I get race conditions or something, anyway it does currently not work as intended.

Unsure when I will fix it.
